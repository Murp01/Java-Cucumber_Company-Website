Feature: Accordion Widget

The website uses an accordion widget to neatly show subject headers with its content hidden until clicked.
Upon clicking on the subject header the content will be displayed below.  The content can contain links which
when clicked on will redirect to another webpage.  Each segment will remain open when another has been clicked
on.  When arriving on a webage that contains an accordion feature all segments will be closed by default
