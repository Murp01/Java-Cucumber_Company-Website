# AdvancedFW_Template01
There are 2 main branches in this repository. 

### MASTER branch ###
The "Master" branch contains a template that can be used to start a new project.  There is currently demo code for running tests on the BBC website.  This code is to be deleted when starting a new project and replaced with code related to the AUT.

### Advanced Framework ###
The "Advanced Framework" branch contains an example of a project using the "WebUniversity.com".  This Framework was developed through a Udemy course which I would highly recommend for learning about the ins and the outs of the framework (see link below).  

https://www.udemy.com/cucumber-bdd-selenium-java-complete-automation-course/learn/v4/content

Both frameworks have been fully set up and can be executed either individually from the feature files, from a test runner which is pointing at the feature files by Junit, from the POM by right clicking and running from TestNG, or from a batch file (which will need editing to run.
